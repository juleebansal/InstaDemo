                            answer: 'For the best waxing results, the hair on your chin should be at least a quarter-inch long, which is roughly the length of a grain of rice. This allows the wax to properly grip the hair for more effective removal. If your hair is shorter, it is a good idea to wait until it reaches the ideal length for waxing.'

This is because waxing removes hair from the root, which can weaken the hair follicle and lead to thinner hair regrowth.'

Avoid touching or scratching the waxed area, and steer clear of heavy skincare products for at least 24 hours. Applying a gentle, soothing lotion or aloe vera gel can help calm the skin. Also, make sure to exfoliate the area regularly (but not immediately after waxing) to prevent ingrown hairs.'

It's also a good idea to gently clean the inside of your nostrils with a mild soap and water to remove any debris. Avoid using any nasal products that might irritate the skin, such as harsh nasal sprays, for at least 24 hours before your reservation. Lastly, if you're concerned about sensitivity, you might consider taking an over-the-counter pain reliever about 30 minutes before your session, but this is usually unnecessary."

Some people may experience temporary redness immediately after waxing, but this typically subsides within a few hours. Using a soothing lotion as recommended by your Wax Specialist can help to minimize any temporary changes in skin appearance."

Avoid tweezing in between reservations to make sure your eyebrows are long enough. 2. If possible, it’s ideal to arrive makeup-free, specifically avoiding brow filler or powder and eyeshadow. A fresh face will ensure your Wax Specialist can easily assess your shape and remove any unruly hairs. 3. Avoid facial cosmetic treatments before your reservation. This includes any cosmetic injectables or facial treatments like microdermabrasion. Be sure to inform your Wax Specialist if you’re currently using any topical medications on your face. Several skincare medications and ingredients like Retin-A, or glycolic acid, can make your skin extra sensitive, and waxing the area can irritate the skin.Avoid tanning in the sun and spray tanning before your eyebrow wax. Tanning in the sun makes skin overly sensitive, especially if you’re sunburned, and waxing immediately after a spray tan will remove your tan along with those pesky hairs."

                            answer: "It's always best to refer to your doctor if you have any questions about bikini waxing services. For prescribed creams like retin-a or differin, we advise that you stop use seven days prior to your reservation and do not resume use until seven days after your bikini wax. We will not wax you if you're on accutane or have been in the past 6 months. It's very dangerous to wax while on accutane and a doctor's note will be needed to receive services. This is why it's so important to inform our guest service associates of what medications you may be taking so we can provide you with a safe, comfortable waxing experience."

However, you may experience more skin sensitivity due to the hormonal changes your body's going through. Our wax specialists will make you as comfortable as possible during the service. For waxes the last two months of your pregnancy, we recommend checking with your doctor first."

                            answer: "To get the best Brazilian wax results, hair should be about a ¼ inch or about the length of a sprinkle, so that the wax can properly adhere to it."

With the right Brazilian wax prep, a regular waxing schedule, and the proper type of wax, you should feel only a few seconds of discomfort with Brazilian waxing. Plus, our exclusive Comfort Wax® is a hard wax which makes Brazilian waxing super quick and gentle, even for the most sensitive skin."

Each location has their own young guest policy when it comes to providing bikini line waxing services on minors.

                            answer: "To ensure the best results, ensure your hair is about a quarter-inch long, similar to a grain of rice. This length allows the wax to grip the hair properly. Exfoliating the area 24-48 hours before your reservation is also recommended to remove any dead skin cells and ensure cleaner waxing. Lastly, avoid applying lotions or oils on the day of your waxing, as they can interfere with the wax's grip."

                            answer: "A Brazilian wax removes all the hair in the pubic region from front to back. A bikini wax removes hair only from the front. There are two types of bikini waxes: a bikini full wax and a bikini line wax. A bikini full wax removes as little or as much hair from the front as you want, whereas a bikini line wax is a basic tidying and only removes the hair that peeks out of the bikini area."

To soothe your skin, you can apply a gentle, post-wax lotion or aloe vera. Avoid tight clothing, excessive sweating, hot showers, and chlorinated pools for at least 24-48 hours after waxing to prevent irritation. Also, remember to keep the waxed area clean and gently exfoliate a few days post-wax to avoid ingrown hairs."

It's a good idea to gently exfoliate the area a day or two before your session to remove any dead skin cells. On the day of your reservation, come with clean skin and skip the lotions and oils so the wax adheres properly."

Wearing loose, breathable clothing can help prevent irritation. And remember, a little moisturizer (after the initial 48 hours) can keep your skin feeling soft and hydrated."

                            answer: "Not really, but it's wise to take it easy for the first day or two. Your skin may be sensitive immediately after waxing, so avoiding intense workouts or direct sun exposure is a good idea. After that, you should be good to go about your usual routine, enjoying the smooth, clean feeling of your freshly waxed back and shoulders."

                            answer: "1. The best way to prepare for your eyebrow waxing reservation is to ensure your hair has grown out ⅛ to ¼ of an inch, so the wax can adhere to the hair properly. Avoid tweezing in between reservations to make sure your eyebrows are long enough. 2. If possible, it’s ideal to arrive makeup-free, specifically avoiding brow filler or powder and eyeshadow. A fresh face will ensure your Wax Specialist can easily assess your shape and remove any unruly hairs. 3. Avoid facial cosmetic treatments before your reservation. This includes any cosmetic injectables or facial treatments like microdermabrasion. Be sure to inform your Wax Specialist if you’re currently using any topical medications on your face. Several skincare medications and ingredients like Retin-A, or glycolic acid, can make your skin extra sensitive, and waxing the area can irritate the skin.Avoid tanning in the sun and spray tanning before your eyebrow wax. Tanning in the sun makes skin overly sensitive, especially if you’re sunburned, and waxing immediately after a spray tan will remove your tan along with those pesky hairs."

                            question: 'How often should I get my legs waxed?',
                            answer: "The frequency of leg waxing can vary based on individual hair growth, but typically, guests find that waxing every 3 to 4 weeks maintains the best results. Regular waxing can also lead to slower hair regrowth over time, potentially extending the interval between your reservations."

                            question: 'Can I go out in the sun after waxing my legs?',
                            answer: "After waxing, your skin is more sensitive to sunburn. Avoid direct sunlight and tanning beds for at least 24-48 hours post-waxing to prevent irritation or skin damage. If you must go out in the sun, apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with high SPF to protect your freshly waxed legs."
